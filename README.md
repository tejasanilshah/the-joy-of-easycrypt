# The Joy of EasyCrypt: The least painful way to learn Formal Verification

This repo houses learning material for [EasyCrypt](https://github.com/EasyCrypt/easycrypt), a toolset for reasoning about cryptographic proofs. This work is inspired by and written in the style of [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/), a series of electronic textbooks that expound the mathematical underpinnings of reliable software. For concepts related to cryptography we aim to track [The Joy of Cryptography](https://joyofcryptography.com/)(JoC), an open-source undergrad textbook for cryptography. The target audience for this work is anyone who is curious about cryptography, and wants to understand formal verification and computer-aided cryptography with the computational security approach to design level security.*


*<sup>If you do not understand what that means, it is alright, we develop the required background.</sup>

## Prerequisites
We assume that the reader is completely new to the field of cryptography, and for some concepts will refer the reader to JoC when needed. We will offer simplified explanations of concepts needed for formal verification as we go. However, we do expect familiarity with discrete mathematics, and data structures and algorithms. 

Additionally, we require the readers to have basic familiarity with the command line, and the ability to work with the Emacs text editor. If you think you need a refresher on any of these, we provide some resources that can help you get you started.

A tip that we can provide is to simply start and learn as you go. It can be overwhelming from time to time, but you can pick up the necessary knowledge as you go.


As with the original text, *joy is not guaranteed*. These concepts can be hard to grasp, so we ask you to be patient and keep working with the material.
