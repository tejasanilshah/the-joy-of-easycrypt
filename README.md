# The Joy of EasyCrypt

This repo consists of learning material for [EasyCrypt](https://github.com/EasyCrypt/easycrypt), a toolset for reasoning about cryptographic proofs. It inspired by and written in the style of [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/), a series of electronic textbooks that explain the mathematical underpinnings of reliable software. For concepts related to cryptography we aim to track [The Joy of Cryptography](https://joyofcryptography.com/)(JoC), an open-source undergrad textbook for cryptography.

## Target audience:

Anyone curious about cryptography and who wants to understand formal verification and computer-aided cryptography in the computational approach to design-level security<sup>*</sup>. In line with that, we assume that the reader is completely new to the field of cryptography, and for some concepts, the reader will be referred to JoC when needed. We will offer simplified explanations of concepts required for formal verification as we go. We expect familiarity with discrete mathematics, data structures and algorithms, a basic familiarity with the command line and the ability to work with the Emacs text editor. Essentially, if you have a little programming experience, then you should be able to work your way through the ideas presented in this work.

Although Emacs is pretty complex, we only expect the reader to know how to open files and navigate them to begin with. These skills can be learnt quickly with the tutorial that is presented upon a fresh install of Emacs. Additionally, the [guided tour of Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/) is helpful for those who want to know more about what Emacs is capable of and don't want to go through the entire tutorial.

As with the original text, **joy is not guaranteed**. Formal verification can be challenging, so we ask you to be patient and keep working with the material. A tip that we can provide is to start and learn as you go.
