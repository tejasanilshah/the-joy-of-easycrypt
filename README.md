# The Joy of EasyCrypt: The least painful way to learn Formal Verification

This repo consists of learning material for [EasyCrypt](https://github.com/EasyCrypt/easycrypt), a toolset for reasoning about cryptographic proofs. It inspired by and written in the style of [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/), a series of electronic textbooks that explain the mathematical underpinnings of reliable software. For concepts related to cryptography we aim to track [The Joy of Cryptography](https://joyofcryptography.com/)(JoC), an open-source undergrad textbook for cryptography.

## Target audience:

Anyone who is curious about cryptography, and wants to understand formal verification and computer-aided cryptography (in the computational approach to design level security)<sup>*</sup>

In line with that, we assume that the reader is completely new to the field of cryptography, and for some concepts will refer the reader to JoC when needed. We will offer simplified explanations of concepts needed for formal verification as we go. However, we do expect familiarity with discrete mathematics, and data structures and algorithms. Essentially if you have a little bit of programming experience then you should be able to work your way through the ideas.

Additionally, we require the readers to have basic familiarity with the command line, and the ability to work with the Emacs text editor. If you think you need a refresher on any of these, we provide some resources that can help you get you started.

A tip that we can provide is to simply start and learn as you go.

As with JoC, **joy is not guaranteed**.
